# Repro attempt of evaluated symbols getting lost

We've had reports about evaluated symbols being unloaded. See [src/bar.clj](src/bar.clj) for repro attempt instructions.

It's probably more to it than this minimal project can expose. If you think you have a repro, please use this project as a base and describe the changes (a comparison from a fork of the Calva repro, or some other way).
