;; === Example 1 - s-expresions
;; Expressions starting on the current line past the cursor are killed
;;


(a| b (c
       d) e)

(a| b (c
       d) e)

;; Example 1b
(aa| (c (e
         f)) g)

(aa| (c (e
         f)) g)

;; === Example 2 - comments
;; Comment killed
(a| ;; comment
 e)

(a| ;; comment
 e)

;; Example 3 - newline
;; newline killed
(a|
 e)

(a|
 e)

;; Example 4 - end of list
;; Don't kill past it

(a b (c |)
   e)

(a b (c |)
   e)

;; Example 5 -- end of string
"This| is a string"

;; Example 6 -- to the newline
"This| is a multiline
string. "

;; Example 7 -- bindings
;; Killing the bound symbol also kills the corresponding expr for a, b, m and c.
;; Not by design but interesting and useful emergent behavior.
;; killing from d of course kills rest of the vector's elements

;; Exmaple 8 -- map key value pairs
;; killing from :c includes the corresponding value
{:a 1
 :b 2
 :c {:d 4
     :e 5}}

{:a 1
 :b 2
 :c {:d 4
     :e 5}}

;; Example 9 -- deleteing from #_ should delete whole expr
[#_(comment
     (+ 2 3))]

[#_(comment
     (+ 2 3))]

;; Example 10 -- deleting from | should delete to eol
;; | (23 34
;;   )


;; Example 11 -- Deleting should delete whole expr to closing ]
| 24 [1]

| 24 [1]

    3]

43 [1 2
    3]

;; Example 12 -- Deleting after a comment kills up to newline
;;| delete me

;; Example 13 -- Delete empty lines

;; Example 14 -- newline in string, deletes to end of string
["abc| def\n ghi" "this stays"]

["abc| def\n ghi" "this stays"]

;; Example 15 -- Heisenbug should delete up to and including g]

           e
