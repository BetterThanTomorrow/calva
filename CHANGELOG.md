## [1.3.x -> 2.0.20] - -> 06.2019

... huge gap in the Changelog. Sorry about that, but now we have decided to pick up maintaining this log again.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-04-16

- Add support for [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org). Please contact me with any information on how this is working for you out there.

## [1.2.14] - 2018-04-06

- Change all keyboard shortcuts to use prefix `ctrl+alt+v`, due to old prefix not working on some alternate keyboard layouts. See [Issue #9](https://github.com/PEZ/clojure4vscode/issues/9).

## [1.2.12] - 2018-04-06

- Add command for re-running previously failing tests (`ctrl+alt+v ctrl+t`).

## [1.2.10] - 2018-04-03

- Add command for toggling automatic adjustment of indentation for new lines (`ctrl+alt+v tab`)

## [1.2.8] - 2018-04-02

- Auto adjust indent more close to this Clojure Style Guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide

## [1.2.1] - 2018-03-28

- Select current (auto-detected) form

## [1.2.0] - 2018-03-28

- Terminal REPLs
  - Integrates REPL sessions from the Terminal tab and lets you do stuff like load current namespace ad evaluate code from the editor in the REPL.
- Connection and reconnection stabilization
  - Connecting the editor REPLs was a bit unstable. Now more stable (but there are still some quirks).

## [1.1.20] - 2018-03-25

- Auto detection of forms to evaluate now considers reader macro characters prepending the forms. E.g. before if you tried to evaluate say `#{:a :b :c}` with the cursor placed directly adjacent to the starting or ending curly braces only `{:a :b :c}` would be auto detected and evaluated.
- Highlighting of auto detected forms being evaluated.
- Rendering evaluation errors in the editor the same way as successful (but in red to quickly indicate that the evaluation errored).

![Evaluation demo](/assets/howto/evaluate.gif)

## [1.1.15] - 2018-03-20

- Evaluates vectors and maps with the same ”smart” selection as for lists.

## [1.1.11] - 2018-03-20

- Add inline annotations for interactive code evaluation results.

## [1.1.9] - 2018-03-18

- Add toggle for switching which repl connection is used for `cljc` files, `clj` or `cljs`.

![CLJC repl switching](/assets/howto/cljc-clj-cljs.gif)

- `clj` repl connected to all file types, meaning you can evaluate clojure code in, say, Markdown files.

## [1,1.3] - 2018-03-17

- User setting to evaluate namespace on save/open file (defaults to **on**)

## [1.1.1] - 2018-03-16

- Release of v1, based on **visual:clojure** v2.0, adding:
  - Running tests through the REPL connection, and mark them in the Problems tab
    - Run namespace tests: `ctrl+alt+v t`
    - Run all tests: `ctrl+alt+v a`
  - Evaluate code and replace it in the editor, inline: `ctrl+alt+v e`
  - Error message when evaluation fails
  - Pretty printing evaluation results: `ctrl+alt+v p`
  - Support for `cljc` files (this was supposed to be supported by the original extension, but bug)
