# Calva: Clojure & ClojureScript with Visual Studio Code

![Calva logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/dev/assets/calva-64h.png)

Welcome to [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva), an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes inline code evaluation, Paredit, a Clojure formatter, a test runner, Clojure syntax highlighting, and more. Much of the power is harvested from the produce of [The Orchard](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard).

*Calva is short for Calvados, a liquid gifted to humanity from God. It is distilled from [Cider](https://cider.mx/).*

## Why Calva?

From [The Tao of Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki):

> Calva's _raison d´être_ is to provide Visual Studio Code users with an easy to use and productive environment for [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) development.


From the same page you can also learn that we want Calva to be a good choice for VS Code users asking:

> _How do I use my favorite code editor for Clojure development?_

We also hope that Calva will contribute to making it easier to pick up Clojure as a new language.

## Getting Started with Calva

Go to the [documentation](https://calva.readthedocs.io/) to find info on how to connect Calva to your project and start evaluating code and such. The documentation is built from the same repository as Calva. So if you know about workarounds or gotchas or anything that is good to know about when using Calva, please edit the appropriate page (or create a new page) by PR.

## Features
- Syntax highlighting, plus:
  - Rainbow parens
  - Highlights misplaced brackets
  - LISP friendly bracket matching
  - Ignore form (`#_`) dimming and `(comment)` form highlighting
- Code formatting and autoindent according to https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide
- Structural Editing (via [Paredit](https://calva.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paredit.html))
- [Linting](https://calva.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linting.html)
- Intellisense
- Go to / Peek at definition
- View docstrings on hover
- View function signatures on hover
- Support for [Clojure tools/deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli), [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org), [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org), [lein-figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel), and [Figwheel Main](https://figwheel.org), and Nashorn repls. (For [Boot](https://boot-clj.com), only Connect scenarios work, there is no Jack-in yet.)
- Your [Custom Connect Sequences](https://calva.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connect-sequences.html), including fully customized CLJS REPLs.
- Switch the CLJS REPL connection between your different CLJS builds at will.
- When editing `cljc` files, easily choose if REPL commands should go to the `clj` or `cljs` REPL by clicking the `cljc/clj[s]` indicator in the status bar.
- And more

## How to contribute

I'm glad you are reading this section!

Calva is built using a combination of TypeScript and ClojureScript. The ClojureScript part uses the [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org) toolchain. See the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki/How-to-Contribute) page on the wiki for instructions on how to hack on Calva.
