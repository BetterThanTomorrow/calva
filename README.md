# Calva: A Clojure & ClojureScript IDE in Visual Studio Code

![Calva logo](assets/calva-64h.png)

_Distilled from [CIDER](https://cider.mx/)*._

Welcome to [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva), an integrated, REPL powered, development environment for enjoyable and productive [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) programming in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes:

* inline [code evaluation](https://calva.io/evaluation/)
* [structural editing](https://calva.io/paredit/)
* code [formatting](https://calva.io/formatting/)
* code navigation
* a [debugger](https://calva.io/debugger/)
* [linting](https://calva.io/linting/)
* syntax highlighting
* Clojure aware rainbow brackets
* a [test runner](https://calva.io/test-runner/)
* refactoring support
* and much more.

A lot of effort has been put into making Calva a good choice to start if you are new to Clojure. [Calva is open source](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) and free to use.

(*) Calva is short for Calvados, a liquid gifted to humanity from God. Calvas's REPL power is harvested from the produce of [The Orchard](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard).

## Users Like it 😍

Crispin Bennett's review:
> This is great, and makes VS Code a truly viable IDE/editor for clojure development. It has great REPL support (including inline evaluation), an extensive Paredit implementation, and excellent linting (care of the bundled clj-kondo). Calva is being improved on at an impressive clip by maintainers who appear solidly committed to its ongoing development. It's well-documented, and manages to be both approachable and capable. A no-brainer if you're already a VS Code user, and well worth a look if you're not.

## It's Easy to Get Started

[Get Started with Clojure in VS Code in 20 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6GrXXhCzCc)

## There is Documentation

Head over to [calva.io](https://calva.io/) to learn more about how to use Calva. The most important stuff would be:

* [Connect Calva to Your Project](https://calva.io/connect/) (TL;DR; Use **Jack in**.)
* [Quirks](https://calva.io/quirks/) (Yes, there are quirks.)
* [Paredit – a Visual Guide](https://calva.io/paredit/) (Clojure editing is for civilized people.)

## Why Calva?

From [The Tao of Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki):

> Calva's _raison d´être_ is to provide Visual Studio Code users with an easy to use and productive environment for [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org) and [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org) development.

From the same page you can also learn that we want Calva to be a good choice for VS Code users asking:

> _How do I use my favorite code editor for Clojure development?_

We also hope that Calva will contribute to making it easier to pick up Clojure as a new language.

## Getting Started with Calva

Go to the [documentation](https://calva.io/) to find info on how to connect Calva to your project and start evaluating code and such. The documentation is built from this repository, and the source files are located in `docs/site`. So if you know about workarounds or gotchas or anything that is good to know about when using Calva, please edit the appropriate page (or create a new page) by PR.

### Powered in Part by Clojure-lsp

Calva uses a mix of static and dynamic analysis to power the experience. A lot of the static abilities come from [clojure-lsp](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp), and you can read more about [Calva's integration of clojure-lsp](https://calva.io/clojure-lsp/) in the documentation.

### Demo: Evaluate top level forms inside `(comment...)`

![Top level comment eval](assets/howto/top-level-comment-eval.gif)

The gif demos several more features, apart from the in-comment evaluation, like:

* Signature help while typing function calls
* Evaluation result display is a bit sticky (so you can examine several evaluations at once)
* There is a richer display of results in the hover of the evaluated expression. (From where you can also copy the results to the clipboard)
  * Edit: This feature has been removed in favor of using peek definition. See [here](https://calva.io/output/#peek-at-results). This decision was made due to high memory usage from storing results, but may be added back at some point if it's desired by many users over the peek definition feature. Please [let us know here](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/736) if you'd like this added back.
* Some [structural editing](https://calva.io/paredit/)

### Demo: Signature Help, while Typing

It is pretty educational using the signature help hover to see which argument you are typing when the argument list is using destructuring, or when an argument is threaded in first before the arguments you provide inside the form.

## How to contribute

I'm glad you are reading this section! There are many ways and you are welcome to combine them at will. Be creative 😄:

* Give us feedback.
  * Via [#calva](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/calva/) at the Clojurians Slack.
  * Via filing issues.
* Fix issues. PRs welcome! Calva is built using a combination of TypeScript and ClojureScript. The ClojureScript part uses the [shadow-cljs](http://shadow-cljs.org) tool chain. See the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki/How-to-Contribute) page on the wiki for instructions on how to hack on Calva. TL;DR _It is super easy to get started!_
* Fix typos in the UI and in the docs. It might seem like a small enough thing to not bother about it, but really, typos get in the way of comprehension. Typos are bad, uhm?
* Become a GitHub sponsor. Read on.
