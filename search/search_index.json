A lot of the static abilities come from clojure-lsp . This enables you to check something up in a project, with a lot of navigational and contextual support, without starting a REPL for it. (And once you do start a REPL you'll get even more capabilities, enabled by the dynamic analysis.) Note By default, Calva determines the version of clojure-lsp it uses, and it defaults to latest . To use a different version of clojure-lsp, see the configuration section. Calva does not use the clojure-lsp installed on your system, unless you set the path for clojure-lsp to the installed binary in your settings . You can see what version is being used by running the Clojure-lsp Server Info command, which will also show the version of clj-kondo that's being used as well as other info. Starting the LSP server You don't need to do anything to start clojure-lsp. No install, no commands, no nothing. Calva downloads the correct binary for your operating system if necessary (this should only happen when the clojure-lsp version is updated in a new release of Calva) and then starts it. It does take a while for clojure-lsp to start, though, especially the first time for a new project, when clojure-lsp (via clj-kondo ) indexes the project files. Calva will show a status bar message during the download and while the server is starting, which will go away once the server is ready. However, much of Calva's functionality is available regardless of the LSP server , so please start using Calva while this server is starting. Ignoring LSP cache files Clojure-lsp stores its project analysis information in your project. Git users can add these lines to their project root directory .gitignore : .clj-kondo/cache/ .clj-kondo/.cache/ .lsp/sqlite.*.db Configuration For information about how to configure clojure-lsp, see the settings page of the clojure-lsp docs. Changing the Version of Clojure-lsp Used by Calva By default, Calva will use the latest released clojure-lsp . You can change the version of clojure-lsp used by Calva by setting the calva.clojureLspVersion property to a version of clojure-lsp found in its GitHub releases . This can be helpful if you're debugging an issue with clojure-lsp or you want to try out a feature of a new release that Calva does not yet use. However, you must remember to reset this setting in order for Calva to automatically use newer versions of clojure-lsp that are released with new versions of Calva. Example: \"calva.clojureLspVersion\" : \"2021.04.07-16.34.10\" If you have specified a version and want to use the latest release, either remove the setting, or set it to latest . Using a Custom Clojure-lsp Native Binary You can set a path to a clojure-lsp binary to be used by Calva by setting the calva.clojureLspPath setting. This should be an absolute path. When this is set, the binary at the path will be used and the calva.clojureLspVersion setting will be ignored. Example: \"calva.clojureLspPath\" : \"/usr/local/bin/clojure-lsp\" Troubleshooting Viewing the Logs Between the Client and Server If something doesn't seem to be working correctly, and you suspect the issue is related to clojure-lsp, a good place to start investigating is the request and response logs between the LSP client and server. In your settings, set clojure.trace.server to verbose , then in the VS Code output tab, select the Clojure Language Client output channel. It may be helpful to clear the output channel, then perform the action with which you're experiencing a problem, then read through the log for clues or paste the logs into a related issue in the Calva repo. Server Info Command You can run the Clojure-lsp Server Info command to get information about the running clojure-lsp server, such as the version the server being used, the version of clj-kondo it's using, and more. This info is printed to the \"Calva says\" output channel. Opening the Server Log File You can open the clojure-lsp log file by running the command Calva Diagnostics: Open Clojure-lsp Log File . The log file will only be opened with this command if the clojure-lsp server is running and has finished initializing. If you need to open the file when the server is failing to run or initialize, see the clojure-lsp docs for information on the file location.

Even some templates add this kind of complexity. To make Jack-in usable for a broader set of projects, Calva has a setting keyed calva.replConnectSequences which lets you configure one ore more connect sequences. NB: Connect sequence configuration affects Calva's Jack-in menu in the following ways: With no sequence configured, Calva will prompt for the built-in sequences it has that seems to match your project. When any number of connection sequences are configured, Calva will prompt for your custom sequences, as well as the built-in sequences. Whether built-in or custom, only sequences relevant to your project will be included in the prompt. Settings for adding Custom Sequences A connect sequence configures the following: name : (required) This will show up in the Jack-in quick-pick menu when you start Jack-in (see above). projectType : (required) This is either \"Leiningen\u201d, \u201ddeps.edn\u201d, \u201dshadow-cljs\u201d, \u201dlein-shadow\u201d, or \u201dgeneric\". nReplPortFile : An array of path segments with the project root-relative path to the nREPL port file for this connect sequence. E.g. For shadow-cljs this would be [\".shadow-cljs\", \"nrepl.port\"] . afterCLJReplJackInCode : Here you can give Calva some Clojure code to evaluate in the CLJ REPL, once it has been created. cljsType : This can be either \"Figwheel Main\", \"shadow-cljs\", \"ClojureScript built-in for browser\", \"ClojureScript built-in for node\", \"lein-figwheel\", \"none\", or a dictionary configuring a custom type. If set to \"none\", Calva will skip connecting a ClojureScript repl. A custom type has the following fields: dependsOn : (required) Calva will use this to determine which dependencies it will add when starting the project (Jacking in). This can be either \"Figwheel Main\", \"shadow-cljs\", \"ClojureScript built-in for browser\", \"ClojureScript built-in for node\", \"lein-figwheel\", or \u201dUser provided\u201d. If it is \"User provided\", then you need to provide the dependencies in the project or launch with an alias (deps.edn), profile (Leiningen), or build (shadow-cljs) that provides the dependencies needed. isStarted : Boolean. For CLJS REPLs that Calva does not need to start, set this to true. (If you base your custom cljs repl on a shadow-cljs workflow, for instance.) startCode : Clojure code to be evaluated to create and/or start your custom CLJS REPL. isStartedRegExp : A regular expression which, when matched in the stdout from the startCode evaluation, will make Calva continue with connecting the REPL, and to prompt the user to start the application. If omitted and there is startCode Calva will continue when that code is evaluated. openUrlRegExp : A regular expression, matched against the stdout of cljsType evaluations, for extracting the URL with which the app can be started. The expression should have a capturing group named url . E.g. \"Open URL: (?\\<url>S+)\" shouldOpenUrl : Choose if Calva should automatically open the URL for you or not. connectCode : (required) Clojure code to be evaluated to convert the REPL to a CLJS REPL that Calva can use to connect to the application. (For some setups this could also conditionally start the CLJS REPL. If so: startCode should be omitted.) isConnectedRegExp : (required) A regular expression which, when matched in the stdout from the connectCode evaluation, will tell Calva that the application is connected. The default is To quit, type: :cljs/quit and you should leave it at that unless you know it won't work. printThisLineRegExp : regular expression which, when matched in the stdout from any code evaluations in the cljsType , will make the matched text be printed to the Output window . buildsRequired : Boolean. If the repl type requires that builds are started in order to connect to them, set this to true. menuSelections : a dictionary with pre-filled-in selections for the Jack-in and Connect prompts, making Calva not prompt for that particular selection: leinProfiles : At Jack-in to a Leiningen project, use these profiles to launch the repl. leinAlias : At Jack-in to a Leiningen project, launch with this alias. Set to null to launch with Calva's default task (a headless repl), w/o prompting. cljAliases : At Jack-in to a deps.edn project, use these aliases to launch the repl. cljsLaunchBuilds : The cljs builds to start/watch at Jack-in/connect. cljsDefaultBuild : Which cljs build to attach to at the initial connect. jackInEnv : An object with environment variables that will be merged with the global calva.jackInEnv and then applied to the Jack-in process. The merge is very similar to how Clojure's merge works. So for any common keys between the global setting and this one, the ones from this setting will win. The Calva built-in sequences also use this format, check them out to get a clearer picture of how these settings work. Apropos the ClojureScript nREPL Server built-in sequence Because of ancient decisions in the design of Calva session managament, the current implementation of the ClojureScript nREPL Server connect sequence is a workaround. Calva will still indicate that it has a Clojure session available, which is nonsense in a pure ClojureScript nREPL environment. This session is also a ClojureScript session. Example Sequences Setting for a full-stack application. It starts the backend server when the CLJ REPL has started. Then proceeds to create a custom CLJS REPL (calling in to the application code for this). And then connects to it. { \"calva.replConnectSequences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Example Sequence\" , \"projectType\" : \"Clojure-CLI\" , \"afterCLJReplJackInCode\" : \"(go)\" , \"cljsType\" : { \"startCode\" : \"(do (require '[cljs-test.main :refer :all])(start-nrepl+fig))\" , \"isStartedRegExp\" : \"Prompt will show\" , \"connectCode\" : \"(do (use 'cljs-test.main) (cljs-repl))\" , \"isConnectedRegExp\" : \"To quit, type: :cljs/quit\" , \"printThisLineRegExp\" : \"\\\\[Figwheel\\\\] Starting Server at.*\" } } ] } Here is an example from the JUXT Edge project template. It adds two sequences, one for when only the Clojure REPL should be launched and one for when the customized Edge cljs repl should also be connected. The Edge backend + frontend sequence specifies that the web app should be opened by Calva, making cljs repl connection more stable, and also adds menuSelections to skip the launch aliases prompt. { \"calva.replConnectSequences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Edge backend only\" , \"projectType\" : \"deps.edn\" }, { \"name\" : \"Edge backend + frontend\" , \"projectType\" : \"deps.edn\" , \"cljsType\" : { \"dependsOn\" : \"Figwheel Main\" , \"startCode\" : \"(do (require 'dev-extras) (dev-extras/go) (println \\\"Edge Figwheel Main started\\\") ((resolve 'dev-extras/cljs-repl)))\" , \"isReadyToStartRegExp\" : \"Edge Figwheel Main started\" , \"openUrlRegExp\" : \"Website listening on: (?<url>\\\\S+)\" , \"printThisLineRegExp\" : \"\\\\[Edge\\\\]\" , \"shouldOpenUrl\" : true , \"connectCode\" : \"(do (require 'dev-extras) ((resolve 'dev-extras/cljs-repl)))\" , \"isConnectedRegExp\" : \"To quit, type: :cljs/quit\" , \"buildsRequired\" : false }, \"menuSelections\" : { \"cljAliases\" : [ \"dev\" , \"build\" , \"dev/build\" ], } } ] } A deps.edn sequence that does not promote the ClojureScript repl at all (leaving it a Clojure REPL), and leaves that up to you to do interactively. (Could be useful while you are developing a custom cljs repl.) The example is for when adapting a Figwheel Main repl. { \"calva.replConnectSequences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Do not promote to cljs\" , \"projectType\" : \"deps.edn\" , \"cljsType\" : { \"dependsOn\" : \"Figwheel Main\" , \"connectCode\" : \"\\\"Don't promote me bro!\\\"\" , \"isConnectedRegExp\" : \"Don't promote me bro!\" } } ] }","title":"REPL Jack-in and Connection Sequences"},{"location":"connect-sequences/#repl-jack-in-and-connection-sequences","text":"Many projects grow out of the template phase and call for custom developer workflows involving application start commands, customized REPLs, and what have you.

Set to null to launch with Calva's default task (a headless repl), w/o prompting. cljAliases : At Jack-in to a deps.edn project, use these aliases to launch the repl. cljsLaunchBuilds : The cljs builds to start/watch at Jack-in/connect. cljsDefaultBuild : Which cljs build to attach to at the initial connect. jackInEnv : An object with environment variables that will be merged with the global calva.jackInEnv and then applied to the Jack-in process. The merge is very similar to how Clojure's merge works. So for any common keys between the global setting and this one, the ones from this setting will win. The Calva built-in sequences also use this format, check them out to get a clearer picture of how these settings work. Apropos the ClojureScript nREPL Server built-in sequence Because of ancient decisions in the design of Calva session managament, the current implementation of the ClojureScript nREPL Server connect sequence is a workaround. Calva will still indicate that it has a Clojure session available, which is nonsense in a pure ClojureScript nREPL environment. This session is also a ClojureScript session.","title":"Settings for adding Custom Sequences"},{"location":"connect-sequences/#example-sequences","text":"Setting for a full-stack application.

It adds two sequences, one for when only the Clojure REPL should be launched and one for when the customized Edge cljs repl should also be connected. The Edge backend + frontend sequence specifies that the web app should be opened by Calva, making cljs repl connection more stable, and also adds menuSelections to skip the launch aliases prompt. { \"calva.replConnectSequences\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Edge backend only\" , \"projectType\" : \"deps.edn\" }, { \"name\" : \"Edge backend + frontend\" , \"projectType\" : \"deps.edn\" , \"cljsType\" : { \"dependsOn\" : \"Figwheel Main\" , \"startCode\" : \"(do (require 'dev-extras) (dev-extras/go) (println \\\"Edge Figwheel Main started\\\") ((resolve 'dev-extras/cljs-repl)))\" , \"isReadyToStartRegExp\" : \"Edge Figwheel Main started\" , \"openUrlRegExp\" : \"Website listening on: (?<url>\\\\S+)\" , \"printThisLineRegExp\" : \"\\\\[Edge\\\\]\" , \"shouldOpenUrl\" : true , \"connectCode\" : \"(do (require 'dev-extras) ((resolve 'dev-extras/cljs-repl)))\" , \"isConnectedRegExp\" : \"To quit, type: :cljs/quit\" , \"buildsRequired\" : false }, \"menuSelections\" : { \"cljAliases\" : [ \"dev\" , \"build\" , \"dev/build\" ], } } ] } A deps.edn sequence that does not promote the ClojureScript repl at all (leaving it a Clojure REPL), and leaves that up to you to do interactively.

This is often referred to as Jack in (because that is what it is called in CIDER). Jack-in supports both CLJ and for CLJS, and has built-in configurations for Leiningen , deps.edn , and shadow-cljs projects, as well as for the CLJS repl types: Figwheel Main , lein-figwheel (legacy Figwheel), shadow-cljs , and ClojureScript built-ins for both browser and node.js. Using jack-in provides your development environment with all the dependencies you need for Calva to work. It works like so: Open your project root directory in VS Code. Issue the command Start a Project REPL and Connect : ctrl+alt+c ctrl+alt+j . Answer the quick-pick prompts telling Calva about project types and what profiles to start. (See the Jack-in Project Types and Profiles wiki page for more info if needed.) See also: Workspace Layouts Note You must have a project file, such as project.clj for Leiningen or deps.edn for deps.edn, in the directory opened in VS Code in order for jack-in to work. If, after adding the project file, you experience an error during jack-in that says something could not be located, make sure you have the correct dependencies in your project file. For example, when using the Figwheel Main project type, you should have com.bhauman/figwheel-main in your project dependencies. Aliases, Profiles, Builds When Jack-in starts it will depend on the project type, and whether ClojureScript is involved or not, and if it is, what kind of ClojureScript project, what will happen next. Calva will analyze the project files and will then give you prompts with selections based on what is found there. You will need some basic knowledge about the project and the project type terminologies to answer the prompts. There are ways to tell Calva the answers to these prompts beforehand, so that Jack-in can be a zero-prompting command. Read on. Customizing Jack-in The main mechanism for customizing your Jack-in, including automating menu selections, and custom CLJS REPL types is Custom Connect Sequences . There are also these settings: calva.jackInEnv : An object with environment variables that will be added to the environment of the Jack-in process. calva.myCljAliases : An array of deps.edn aliases not found in the project file. Use this to tell Calva Jack-in to launch your REPL using your user defined aliases. calva.myLeinProfiles : An array of Leiningen profiles not found in project.clj . Use this to tell Calva Jack-in to launch your REPL using your user defined profiles. calva.openBrowserWhenFigwheelStarted : For Legacy Figwheel only. A boolean controlling if Calva should automatically launch your ClojureScript app, once it is compiled by Figwheel. Defaults to true . Note When processing the calva.jackInEnv setting you can refer to existing ENV variables with ${env:VARIABLE} . Connecting Without Jack-in If, for whatever reasons, you can't use Jack-in with your project (possibly because the REPL is started as part of some other job) all is not lost. Old fashioned Connect to a running REPL is still there for you. For all features to work in Calva while connecting to a running REPL, your environment needs to have REPL related dependencies set up. However, just as before it can be tricky to get the dependencies right. Consider using Jack in to inform yourself on how to start your REPL to Calva's satisfaction. When you use Jack in, Calva starts a VS Code task for it and the command line used is displayed in the terminal pane used to handle the task. Reading that command line tells you what dependencies are needed for your project. Even better: Copying that command line gives you the command to start the REPL with the correct dependencies. All this said, I still recommend you challenge the conclusion that you can't use Jack-in. Note There is a Calva command for copying the Jack-in command line to the clipboard. Troubleshooting Command Not Found Errors When Jacking In If you get command not found error when Calva tries to start your project, and you know you have the command installed, it's probably because VS Code starts from an environment where the command is not on the $PATH . It can look like so: lein update-in :dependencies conj '[nrepl,\"0.8.3\"]' -- update-in :plugins conj '[cider/cider-nrepl,\"0.25.8\"]' -- update-in '[:repl-options,:nrepl-middleware]' conj '[\"cider.nrepl/cider-middleware\"]' -- repl :headless /bin/sh: lein: command not found Jack-in process exited. Status: 127 The fix is to always start VS Code from the command line: $ code You might need to first run the Shell Command: Install code command in PATH . This will also make sure your REPL has access to the environment you probably expect it to have access to. See below. Environment Variables Are Not Readable From REPL If you've added environment variables in your OS, such as in your ~/.bashrc file (Linux), in order for them to be read in a REPL created by Calva's jackin command, VS Code must be started from a shell where the environment variables are defined.

On this page we can collect some of the customizations that people have done, and maybe write a thing or two about it some day. Tip for VS Code newcomers: The search box in Settings is your friend. Also, some Calva settings are more complex than the Settings UI can handle. VS Code will then show you a link to settings.json . And VS Code's built-in json extension is awesome. To add settings for Calva's Pretty Printing, for example, search for \u201dprettyprint\u201d in VS Code Settings and follow the link to settings.json . Start typing \u201dcalvapretty\u201d until auto-complete suggests calva.prettyPrintingOptions . Press ENTER and VS Code will fill in these defaults: \"calva.prettyPrintingOptions\" : { \"enabled\" : true , \"printEngine\" : \"pprint\" , \"width\" : 40 }, Clojure Defaults Calva sets some VS Code settings for all Clojure files. Some of these are needed for Calva to function correctly, which should not be tampered with unless you really know what you are doing, and some of them are convenient defaults. If you add a setting to your settings.json and accept the snippet help you get when you type \"[clojure]\" , you will get the Calva defaults pasted: \"[clojure]\" : { \"editor.wordSeparators\" : \"\\t ()\\\"':,;~@#$%^&{}[]`\" , \"editor.autoClosingBrackets\" : \"always\" , \"editor.autoClosingQuotes\" : \"always\" , \"editor.formatOnType\" : true , \"editor.autoIndent\" : \"full\" , \"editor.formatOnPaste\" : true , \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\" : false , \"editor.matchBrackets\" : \"never\" , \"editor.renderIndentGuides\" : false , \"editor.parameterHints.enabled\" : false } Note The above editor.wordSeparators setting establish Clojure word boundaries. E.g - is considered to be part of words. This affects what happens when double-clicking symbols and other things. If you want to include - or something else as a word boundary, just add it to the setting. Pretty Printing Calva's pretty printing mode can be configured a bit. See Pretty Printing . Calva Highlight Calva takes care of syntax highlighting, and also provides some features not available through VS Code's highlighting mechanism. These extras include rainbow parens, sane bracket matching, and comment form dimming/highlighting. You are in charge of how brackets and comments are highlighted via the calva.highlight.<setting> settings: Setting Meaning Example enableBracketColors Enable rainbow colors true rainbowIndentGuides Enable rainbow indent guides true highlightActiveIndent Highlight the active indent guide true bracketColors Which colors to use [\"#000\", \"#999\"] cycleBracketColors Whether same colors should be reused for deeply nested brackets true misplacedBracketStyle Style of misplaced bracket { \"border\": \"2px solid #c33\" } matchedBracketStyle Style of bracket pair highlight {\"backgroundColor\": \"#E0E0E0\"} ignoredFormStyle Style of #_... form {\"textDecoration\": \"none; opacity: 0.5\"} commentFormStyle Style of (comment ...) form {\"fontStyle\": \"italic\"} Calva disables the VS Code built-in indent guides The VS Code built-in settings editor.renderIndentGuides and editor.highlightActiveIndent do not have any effect, since the former is switched off by the Clojure Defaults , mentioned above. Use Calva Highlight's rainbowIndentGuides and highlightActiveIndent instead. They are different from the built in ones in that they are independent, meaning you can choose to have active indent highlighted while the guides generally are not rendered (this is the default, even). VS Code bracket coloring vs Calva's Calva's bracket coloring is more Clojure aware than VS Code's built-in coloring. And also will chime better with Calva's indent guides. If you like to have bracket coloring outside Clojure code, by all means enable it. Calva's bracket coloring will \u201dover paint\u201d in Clojure files, when enabled. These settings work nicely: \"calva.highlight.highlightActiveIndent\" : true , \"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled\" : true , The calva.highlight.bracketColors setting can be used to harmonize the coloring between VS Code and Calva. Automatic Parameter Hints Poppup Calva has helpful parameter hints to aid when typing function calls. They look like so: To have the hints automatically pop up when you are typing, set editor.parameterHints.enabled to true in the above [clojure] scoped setting. (To call them up on demand the default VS Code keybindings are cmd+shift+space on Mac and ctrl+shift+space on Linux/Windows.) Code Formatting See Formatting for information on how to configure this. Jack-in and Connect Sequences Jack-in and Connect are very customizable through Custom Connect Sequences . Jack-in Dependency Versions The versions of the dependencies Calva Jack-in injects in order for the REPL session to support IDE features are configurable via the VS Code settings calva.jackInDependencyVersions . At the time of this writing the default versions are: Dependency Version Description nrepl 0.8.3 nREPL is the wonderful piece of software that gives Calva a structured and extensible connection to the REPL in your Clojure and ClojureScript projects. cider-nrepl 0.25.8 cider-nrepl is middleware that extends the nREPL connection with all sorts of nice stuff that Calva uses to give you a delightful IDE experience. cider/piggieback 0.5.2 Piggieback is used to create nREPL sessions in ClojureScript projects. (Not with shadow-cljs projects though, which provides its own middleware for this.) Key bindings Most of Calva's commands have default keybindings. They are only defaults, though, and you can change keybindings as you wish. To facilitate precision in binding keys Calva keeps some when clause contexts updated.

This library is loaded as a dependency when you use Calva Jack-in. If you are not using Calva Jack-in, you can add these dependencies in your project definition or user profile. See the Calva Jack-in guide for more information. Using the Debugger If you're new to Clojure or expression-based debuggers, this debugger may function differently than what you're used to. Instead of placing breakpoints in the side margin and then hitting F5 to start debugging, you instead use Clojure reader tags, #break and #dbg , to denote breakpoints anywhere in a Clojure form. When you evaluate a call to a function that has been evaluated with that reader tag, the debugger will start when execution reaches the first breakpoint. There's also a convenience command to instrument functions. Read below about both options. Note The debugger is not configured via a launch.json file, and is not started in the same way as you may be used to when working with other languages in VS Code. The debugger is used by way of the REPL. If you are new to Clojure, please visit the Getting Started section of the documentation and get familiar with evaluating code using the REPL before using the debugger. Instrumenting a Function You can instrument a top level function for debugging with ctrl+alt+c i . This places invisible breakpoints throughout the function where pausing makes sense. When you evaluate a call to this function, the debugger will start and execution will pause at the first breakpoint. Annotations show the value of the form at the cursor. A border is placed around the definition of the instrumented function and its references to show that it's instrumented. You can remove instrumentation by evaluating the function again normally, such as with alt+enter . Setting Breakpoints with #break You can insert a breakpoint manually into any code by placing a #break in front of the form where you want execution to pause, and then evaluating the top level form with alt+enter . When you evaluate a call to this code the VS Code debugger will start, the cursor will move to right after the form that's preceded by #break , and the line will be highlighted to show execution is paused there. Note Code will be executed up to and including the form after the breakpoint. Conditional Breakpoints You can set conditional breapoints by adding metadata before the form that the #break applies to. ( defn print-nums [ n ] ( dotimes [ i n ] # break ^ { :break/when ( = i 7 )} ;; This breakpoint will only be hit when i equals 7 ( prn i ))) Instrumenting a Form with #dbg Adding #dbg before a form then evaluating the form with alt+enter will instrument the form. This has the same effect as using the instrument command . Evaluating Code in the Paused Context When execution is paused at a breakpoint, you can evaluate code in that context. This can be done in the editor or in the REPL window, as usual. Viewing Variable Values While debugging, you can view the values of variables in VS Code's debugger side pane. You can also view values by hovering over the variables in the editor. Currently, values for collections and maps are shown as strings, but we plan to make them structured in the future. For now, if you want to see the value of a large structured variable, you can evaluate the variable from the editor or from the REPL window. Viewing the Call Stack While debugging, you can view the call stack in VS Code's call stack side pane. Clicking the stack frames will show the related line of code in an editor. Note You may only see one stack frame in the call stack side pane, as the change for adding additional frames was rolled back due to an issue. You can follow the change for this at #1150 . Stepping Commands You can use VS Code's debugger UI to advance execution while debugging. Note Clicking restart does nothing, since this functionality does not make sense for our debugger. Continue - Continues without stopping for the current breakpoint Step over - Continues to the next breakpoint Step in - Steps in to the function about to be called. If the next breakpoint is not around a function call, does the same as next. Note that not all functions can be stepped in to - only normal functions stored in vars, for which cider-nrepl can find the source. You cannot currently step in to multimethods, protocol functions, or functions in clojure.core (although multimethods and protocols can be instrumented manually). Step out - Steps to the next breakpoint that is outside of the current sexp Restart - Does nothing. To restart debugging, you can hit disconnect or continue execution through the final result, then re-evaluate the expression that started the debugger. Disconnect - Disconnects the debugger Caveats Breakpoints in loop/recur One construct where the debugger is limited is loop / recur . As recur always has to appear in a tail-position inside a loop or a fn and the debugger uses macros to interleave breakpoints in the forms, it might happen that a recur no longer appears in a tail position. In that case we have to avoid setting up the breakpoint. An example of such a case is: ( loop [ i 0 ] # break ( when ( < i 10 ) ( println i ) ( recur ( inc i )))) Here the breakpoint is exactly in front of a form that contains as its last expression a recur which is wrapped in a loop. This breakpoint has no effect. This does not mean you cannot use the debugger with loop , it just means you have to set your debug statements more carefully. Loading the File and \"Eval On Save\" When you load a file, any breakpoints that were previously set in functions will be unset. If you have the \"Eval On Save\" setting enabled, your file is also loaded with each save, therefore saving the file will remove breakpoints previously set. Troubleshooting Debugger hangs when stepping over infinite seqs This is because the debugger tries to evaluate the form when it's stepped over, and if clojure.core/*print-length* is set to nil as it is by default, evaluation will never complete. If you want to debug a form with an infinite seq, make sure to set *print-length* beforehand. For example: ( set! *print-length* 3 ) ;; Or, to be more precise ( set! clojure.core/*print-length* 3 ) Calva does not set this for you during debug mode, instead leaving it up to you to decide the value. My breakpoint isn't being hit It's likely that your breakpoint is in a place that cider-nrepl does not see as an appropriate place to break execution. For example, if you put a breakpoint before a literal number, it will not be hit, because there's no need to show the value of a literal. ( defn simple [ x ] ( + 1 # break 1 )) ;; This breakpoint will not be hit Another possible issue is that you're loading the file again after setting breakpoints, which unsets them. See Loading the File and \"Eval On Save\" under Caveats. My breakpoint in a test isn't being hit If you're using the test commands like \"Run current test\" to run your tests, breakpoints will not be hit. This is because Calva loads the file before running the tests to make sure the latest version of test code is being run, and when the file is loaded, breakpoints are unset. If you want a breakpoint to work within the test, evaluate the test form with a breakpoint tag in it, then call the test directly. \"No reader function for tag\" error If you get an error like this, it's likely that you connected to a REPL instead of jacking in, and you don't have the proper depednencies loaded in your REPL. You can run the command \"Copy Jack-in Command to Clipboard\" to see what command would be run if you jacked in. Most importantly, make sure you have cider/cider-nrepl as a dependency, and cider.nrepl/cider-middleware as middleware loaded in your REPL. For example, this is a jack-in command for a deps.edn project: clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version,\"0.8.3\"},cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version,\"0.25.8\"}}}' -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware \"[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]\"","title":"Debugger"},{"location":"debugger/#debugger","text":"Calva comes with a powerful expression-based debugger, inspired by Cider 's debugger, and using the same underlying library, cider-nrepl .

evaluate code, supporting interactive development. The fastest path to learning about it is to use the Fire up the Getting Started REPL command, which you can learn more about in the Getting Started section. NB: The below assumes you have read about Finding Calva Commands and Shortcuts . Evaluation in a File Editor Calva has many commands for evaluating forms, including the current form and the current top-level form . Some of the commands also let you choose what should happen with the results: Inline. This will display the results (or some of it, if it is long) inline in the editor. This also creates a hover pane including the full results and a button which will copy the results to the clipboard. There is also a command for copying the last result to the clipboard. The full results are always available in the output window . There is a command for showing the output window, allowing for a workflow where you either generally have it closed, or have it as one of the tabs in the same editor group as the files you are working with. To comments. This will add the results as line comments below the current line. Replace the evaluated code. This will do what it says, the evaluated code will be replaced with its results. Wait, Current Form? Top-level Form? These are important concepts in Calva in order for you to create your most effective workflow. Current Form Default shortcut for evaluating the current form: ctrl+enter . The current form either means the current selection, or otherwise is based on the cursor position. Play some with the command Calva: Select current form , ctrl+alt+c s , to figure out what Calva thinks is the current form for some different situations. Try it inside a symbol, adjacent to a symbol (both sides) and adjacent to an opening or closing bracket (again, both sides). Generally the current form is determined like so: If text is selected, then that text If the cursor is \u201din\u201d a symbol, then that symbol foob|ar ; foobar If the cursor is adjacent to a form (a symbol or a list of some kind), then that form ( foo bar | ( baz )) ; (baz) If the cursor is between to forms, then the left side form ( foo bar | ( baz )) ; bar If the cursor is before the first form of a line, then that form ( foo | bar ( baz )) ; bar Current Top-level Form Default shortcut for evaluating the current top level form: alt+enter . The current top-level form means top-level in a structural sense. It is not the topmost form in the file. Typically in a Clojure file you will find def and defn (and defwhatever ) forms at the top level, which also is one major intended use for evaluating top level form: to define and redefine variables . However, Calva does not check the contents of the form in order to determine it as a top-level forms: all forms not enclosed in any other form are top level forms . An \u201dexception\u201d is introduced by the comment form. It will create a new top level context, so that any forms immediately inside a (commment ...) form will be considered top-level by Calva. This is to support a workflow with what is often referred to the Rich Comments . At the top level the selection of which form is the current top level form follows the same rules as those for the current form . Evaluate to Cursor There is also a command for evaluating the text from the start of the current list to where the cursor is. Convenient for checking intermediate results in thread or doto , or similar pipelines. The cursor is right behind :d in this form: ( ->> [ 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ] ( partition 2 ) ( zipmap [ :a :b :c :d ]) :d| ; => (12 21) ( apply - ) ( Math/abs )) The default shortcut for this command is ctrl+alt+enter . Evaluate Top Level Form to Cursor This command has a default shortcut keybinding of shift+alt+enter . It will create a form from the start of the current top level form, up to the cursor, then fold the form, closing all brackets, and this will then be evaluated. Good for examining code blocks up to a certain point. Take this example and paste it in a file loaded into the REPL, then place the cursor in front of each line comment and try the command. ( comment ( do ( def colt-express { :name \"Colt Express\" :categories [ \"Family\" \"Strategy\" ] :play-time 40 :ratings { :pez 5.0 :kat 5.0 :wiw 5.0 ; 1, then eval `colt-express` :vig 3.0 :rex 5.0 :lun 4.0 }}) ( defn average [ coll ] ( / ( apply + coll ) ( count coll ))) ( let [ foo-express ( -> colt-express ( assoc :name \"Foo Express\" ) ( assoc-in [ :ratings :lyr ] 5.0 ) ( update-in [ :ratings :vig ] inc ))] ( ->> foo-express ; 2 :ratings ; 3 vals ; 4 average ; 5 )))) Evaluate Enclosing Form The default keyboard shortcut for evaluating the current enclosing form (the list the cursor is in) is ctrl+shift+enter .

Meaning that most often when things look a bit untidy, you can press tab to make things look pretty. Good to know, right? For performance reasons it only formats the current enclosing form, so sometimes you want to move the cursor up/out a form ( ctrl+up ) first. See The Paredit Guide for more on moving the cursor structurally through your code. With the default settings, Calva's formatting behaves like so: formats as you type (when entering new lines) formats the current enclosing form when you hit tab formats pasted code formats according to community standards (see above link) formats the current form, aligning map keys and values , when you press ctrl+alt+l formats (comment ..) forms special, see rich comments Tips Calva has a command that will \u201dheal\u201d the bracket structure if it is correctly indented. Yes, it is Parinfer behind the scenes. This command is default bound to shift+tab to form a nicely balanced pair with the tab formatting. Also: If you have Format on Save enabled in VS Code, it will be Calva doing the formatting for Clojure files.

The formatter is quite configurable. Configuration You configure Calva's formatting using cljfmt's configuration EDN . This means that you can adjust the above mentioned defaults, including the indenting. Note The cljfmt docs mention the :cljfmt config key of Leiningen projects. Calva does not yet read the config from there, so if your Leiningen project has such a configuration, you will need to copy it out into a file. To start changing the Calva formatting defaults, paste the following map into a file and save it. It could be somewhere in the project workspace, or some other place, depending on your requirements: { :remove-surrounding-whitespace? true :remove-trailing-whitespace? true :remove-consecutive-blank-lines? false :insert-missing-whitespace? true :align-associative? false } Then set calva.fmt.configPath to the path to the file. The path should either be absolute, or relative to the project root directory. So, if you named the file .cljfmt.edn and saved it in the root of the project, then this setting should be .cljfmt.edn . Since you are editing the file in Calva (you are, right?), you can quickly test how different settings affect the formatting. Try: setting :align-associative to true then save then hit tab , and see what happens. (This particular setting is experimental and known to cause trouble together with namespaced keywords. Consider using ctrl+alt+l instead of tab as your formatting command, instead of enabling this setting.) Note The hot reloading of the config file only works for config files inside the project directory structure. Indentation rules The cljfmt indents are highly configurable. They, and the rest of the configuration options, are masterly detailed here . Calva is an extra good tool for experimenting with these settings. cljfmt doesn't care about keys in the map that it doesn't know about so you can sneak in test code there to quickly see how it will get formatted by certain rules. Try this, for instance: { :remove-surrounding-whitespace? true :remove-trailing-whitespace? true :remove-consecutive-blank-lines? false :insert-missing-whitespace? false :align-associative? false :indents ^ :replace { # \"^\\w\" [[ :inner 0 ]]} :test-code ( concat [ 2 ] ( map # ( inc ( * % 2 )) ( filter # ( aget sieved % ) ( range 1 hn ))))} Save, then hit tab , and the code should get formatted like so: :test-code ( concat [ 2 ] ( map # ( inc ( * % 2 )) ( filter # ( aget sieved % ) ( range 1 hn )))) That's somewhat similar to Nikita Prokopov's Better Clojure Formatting suggestion.

It also can be used in the zero-installed way. You can regard it as a companion to this guide. It is aimed at practicing Clojure, starting at the elementary levels, bringing you to advanced stuff. Can I use Rich 4Clojure instead of this guide? We suggest you start by opening up this guide and do the Calva part of the excerises. Then use the welcome_to_clojure.clj guide in combination with Rich 4Clojure ..

ClojureDocs Clojurians draw tremendous value from ClojureDocs . At ClojureDocs the concise documentation for Clojure core functions, etcetera, are amended with examples and advice from fellow Clojurians. Crowdsourcing at its very best! It is a big part of the reason why you won't find an abundance of Clojure information at StackOverflow.

It really is helpful, but also really isn't mysterious. Here are a few things about it that is good to know about. Note If you came here to find out how to configure the versions of the dependencies that Calva Jack-in injects, see Customizing Calva - Jack-in Dependency Versions . What it Solves At first it might seem that something like lein repl in a terminal and then connecting Calva is enough. It sometimes might be, but only if you are in luck. To provide many of its IDE features, Calva relies on nREPL middleware, mainly cider-nrepl and, for ClojureScript, piggieback . When starting your Clojure(Script) app and its REPL, it needs to be started with these dependencies satisfied. There are mainly three ways this can be achieved. In the project definition (files like project.clj , deps.edn , shadow-cljs.edn , and combination of these). In your user profile (files like ~/.lein/profiles.clj and ~/.clojure/deps.edn ). On the command line. Because 1 and 2 are hard to keep in sync with the various editor environments people in your project might be using, Calva Jack-In is about 3 . Ideally, you will be able to rid your project files completely of editor dependencies when people working on the project can rely on the Jack-In features of their Clojure editor. A Controlled Shell Command At its core Calva Jack-In is just a glorified, REPL-starting, command-line. No, it is more than that, but anyway. The command line can look like so for a Leiningen project using legacy Figwheel for its ClojureScript assistance: lein update-in :dependencies conj '[nrepl\"0.6.0\"]' -- update-in :dependencies conj '[cider/piggieback\"0.4.1\"]' -- update-in :dependencies conj '[figwheel-sidecar\"0.5.18\"]' -- update-in :plugins conj '[cider/cider-nrepl\"0.22.4\"]' -- update-in '[:repl-options :nrepl-middleware]' conj '[\"cider.nrepl/cider-middleware\"]' -- update-in '[:repl-options :nrepl-middleware]' conj '[\"cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl\"]' -- with-profile +dev repl :headless Even if a bit long, it might look simple enough. But actually it has taken quite some effort to make Calva craft it. Shell quoting can be really tricky. Look at how '[nrepl\"0.6.0\"]' doesn't have a space between nrepl and the version. That was the only way I could find that was cross platform enough to make all supported shells parse the command line. (The trick relies on that the string is read by the super reliable Clojure Reader, which does not need that space to tokenize it.) It is awesome that Clojure is used on so many platforms, but for a tool smith this also means more work. (I think Windows and its shell hell ate up about 95% of the many hours spent on getting the quoting good enough.) The command-line crafted is then used to start a shell command that Calva controls, but we are getting ahead of ourselves... Project Types, Builds, Aliases, Profiles, etcetera In order to cook the right command for your project, Calva looks for project files, reads them, and figures out what possible project types and ClojureScript tools could be involved. Then Calva presents you with a menu with the options it has found. You need to know enough about your project to answer this question. It looks like this in a shadow-cljs project that uses a deps.edn file for setting up its classpath. (I know enough about this particular project to know that I should choose the shadow-cljs project type.) But Calva isn't ready to cook the command-line just yet. Depending on the project type, and contents of your project files, more info is needed. E.g. in the case of shadow-cljs projects, Calva needs to know what builds to start. Here you can select any combination of builds defined in the project, and Calva will cook a command line that starts them. You might get more prompts from Calva before it issues the command, but for this example project, Calva goes ahead, cooks the command line, and issues it. On my Mac, it looks like so: npx shadow-cljs -d cider/piggieback:0.4.1 -d cider/cider-nrepl:0.22.4 watch :app (Much shorter than the one with lein-figwheel, right? It is because shadow-cljs is aware of CIDER dependencies, so it doesn't need as many dependencies specified as some other project types do.) Connecting When the command is issued Calva needs to wait until the REPL Server is started, before connecting to it and possibly continuing with starting a ClojureScript REPL and connecting to that as well. It also needs to know which port to connect to. Because reasons, Calva can't yet read the stdout of the shell command it has issued, so to know when the REPL server is started, and on which port, Calva monitors the filesystem for the .nrepl-port file. (This file is not always named like that. shadow-cljs, for instance, creates the file .shadow-cljs/nrepl.port .) When the port file is created, Calva picks up the port number from it and connects to the nREPL server. At this point you have a Clojure REPL backing your Calva session, providing all sorts of nice IDE help for you. Starting Your Clojure App Once you have the Clojure REPL connected you can start your Clojure app/server. See Custom Connect Sequences for how to let Calva do this for you automatically. See the same article for ways to automate more of the Jack-In process. It can be brought down to a single Jack-In command/action, even for a full stack Clojure and ClojureScript application. ClojureScript For ClojureScript, things are not done yet, though, far from it. It turns out that cooking the command line was the easy part. In order for Calva to provide REPL power for ClojureScript projects, several things need to happen: A Clojure nREPL connection needs to be established. We've covered that above. Calva makes an nREPL session clone to use for the ClojureScript REPL and then: Your ClojureScript app needs to be compiled. Your ClojureScript app needs to be started. The Clojure nREPL session needs to be promoted to a ClojureScript nREPL session. (This is what piggieback helps with.) Compiling the App and Watchers Depending on ClojureScript project type, Calva uses different methods to start the compilation and the watcher: Figwheel: The compilation and the watchers are started in the Clojure REPL session. (This is both for Figwheel Main and for lein-figwheel.) shadow-cljs: The compilation and the watchers are started with the Jack-In command line. This results in a bit of difference in the user interaction. Mainly that for shadow-cljs, the user needs to check the Jack-In Terminal tab to follow what's going on. Starting the App Number 3 above, the app needs to be started , might seem obvious, but it actually trips many people up. Because of this, Calva goes to quite some lengths to provide assistance. Many projects are configured not to spawn a browser session automatically, requesting the app once it has been compiled, so we can't rely on that. What Calva does instead is to monitor the output of the commands it uses for starting the compilation, looking for information that the app is ready to be requested/started. It then tells the user this, providing a URL, in case it is a browser app. (There are also settings that tell Calva to open the URL automatically for you, regardless what the project settings are.) Connecting Meanwhile, Calva is monitoring the output and when it sees that the app is started, it continues to hook up the REPL connection to the editor. This whole connection sequence is quite configurable, using Custom Connect Sequences . In fact, Calva's built in ClojureScript sequences (Figwheel Main, lein-figwheel, shadow-cljs, and ClojureScript built-ins for both Browser and Node) are all built using those same settings mechanisms. shadow-cljs is Less Managed by Calva NB: The managed way in which Calva creates and connects the ClojureScript REPL breaks apart a bit for shadow-cljs, which works a bit differently and also outputs most of the information Calva is looking for on the stdout of the REPL start command (where Calva can't see it, remember?). We'll figure out a better way to support shadow-cljs, but for now, the user needs to do more of this figuring out than is needed with Figwheel projects. Hack Away So, there are things going on when you start Jack-In, and even more things for ClojureScript projects, but Calva tries to keep it together, so as a user it is a matter of paying attention and responding to a few prompts/menus with pre-populated options (prompts which can be configured away, even). Switch ClojureScript Builds Once the REPL is connected you might want to change which ClojureScript build you have Calva connected to. For this Calva has the Select CLJS Build Connection command. Please note that you can only switch between builds that you have started. Play With Starting the cljs-repl Yourself To get a good grip on what is going on when creating and connecting the ClojureScript REPL, I can recommend making a custom connect sequence which leaves the REPL unpromoted (e.g. give it nil as connectCode ), and then evaluate the cljs-repl start commands yourself. So for instance, promoting it to a ClojureScript Node.js REPL looks something like so: user=> ( require 'cljs.repl.node ) user=> ( cider.piggieback/cljs-repl ( cljs.repl.node/repl-env )) ClojureScript 1.10 .844 To quit , type : :cljs/quit nil cljs.user=> | It is the piggieback middleware there telling you that you can unpromote the REPL by \u201devaluating\u201d :cljs/quit . About Full Stack Applications Because Calva uses the Clojure REPL connection to spawn the ClojureScript REPL, and because Calva only handles one Clojure REPL per VS Code window, some projects need special handling by the user. If your full stack project is using shadow-cljs for the frontend, like this Fulcro template project does, maybe you first try to Jack-In to your backend Clojure REPL, and then to your shadow-cljs frontend. This works if you do it in separate VS Code windows, but if you do it in the same window, the second Jack-In will kill the backend session! See Workspace Layouts for tips about how to open the same project folder in two separate VS Code windows. Please Grab your Calva Jack-In Certificate There, you now know all there is to know about Calva Jack-In. Just kidding, there are a few more details to it, some of which might find their way into this article at a later time.

It allows you to share the workspace that you have open in your computer with somebody else. Everybody is then working on the same source code files, namely those on your computer. You can edit files at the same time, everyone has their own caret. You can follow each other (i.e. when someone switches to a different file, you will as well). This is great for remote pair programming, for example. An extra nice thing is that each participant is using their own VSCode configuration, including fonts, colors, keyboard shortcuts, etc. Calva Supports Live Share When using Calva, you can use Live Share as well. Editing works exactly the same as for any other programming language. What makes Calva a bit special, is the REPL. When using Live Share, Calva allows the host to share the REPL with guests as well. If you use any of the supported configuration, this will be pretty much automatic. This is what a typical scenario looks like: The host jacks-in. The host shares its workspace using Live Share. Calva will detect that the workspace is being shared, so it will offer to share the REPL port that was opened when jacking in. The host clicks \"Allow\" to start sharing the port. (Note: steps 1 and two can also be done in the reverse order.) The host sends the Live Share URL to the guest(s). The guest joins the Live Share session using the URL it received. The guest connects to the host's REPL using the command \"Connect to a running REPL server in the project\". If needed, the guest chooses the same build configuration as the host. Voila! Both the guest and the host can now use the REPL that is running on the host. Things like documentation lookup now also work on the guest's machine. Control Visibility of .calva Folder Calva depends on the output.calva-repl file to be available. If you have the .calva folder listed in your .gitignore , this also causes the folder to be hidden from guests in Live Share by default. In order to make the folder visible, you can put a file called .vsls.json in your project. In its simplest form, the contents can be this: { \"$schema\" : \"http://json.schemastore.org/vsls\" , \"hideFiles\" : [ \"!.calva\" ] } Now the .calva folder is shared as well. But also any other file and folder that you may have in your .gitignore . If you want to have more fine-grained control, please refer to the section Controlling file access and visibility of the Live Share documentation. Some Things To Keep In Mind As a guest, you're connected to a REPL running on the host's machine. With power comes responsibility; be nice, and be careful ! There is only one output.calva-repl file, which all participants are sharing. It may work better to evaluate things in the source code editors instead of from the REPL window. Otherwise you will end up in a situation where one person is typing something in the output.calva-repl window, and somebody else is evaluating something (hence sending the output there) at the same time. That gets confusing quickly. When you're working on a CLJS-based web development project, things may get extra confusing. By default, Live Share will share any HTTP ports on the host automatically, and also offer to open the URL on the guest. (You can disable using the setting \"Liveshare: Open Shared Servers\".) As a guest, you do not want to open that browser window normally. Think about it: where is the REPL running? Yes: in the browser! But Calva connects to the REPL running in the browser on the host's machine, so if you open a browser as a guest, you will also get a REPL there, but you won't be connected to it in Calva. Currently Live Share does not allow Calva to know whether the workspace is shared read-only or read-write.

This file is created and opened when Calva is connected to a REPL. In ClojureScript projects the window will be associated with the cljs REPL once this one is connected. It will then look something like so: The first prompt is from when the clj REPL is connected, the second when Calva has a cljs REPL connection. The first part of the prompt tells you which REPL type the window is currently connected to. This gets important when the file/window is used as an interactive REPL. Find the Output/REPL Window If you quickly want to open and switch to the output window there is the command Calva: Show Output Window , ctrl+alt+c o . To sync the Output/REPL window namespace with the current file before switching, use the Switch Namespace of the Output/REPL Window to Current Namespace command, ctrl+alt+c alt+n . Find the File for the Current REPL Window Namespace When you are working from the Output/REPL window, and want to open the file that defines its current namespace, use the Show File for the Current Output/REPL Window Namespace command, ctrl+alt+c o . Note This also works for Clojure core and library namespaces. Evaluating Code The window will be automatically associated with the REPL and the namespace of any project Clojure/ClojureScript file you evaluate code in. So for instance if you evaluate this code in a clj file with the namespace fresh-reagent.handler : ( def mount-target [ :div#app [ :h2 \"Welcome to fresh-reagent\" ] [ :p \"please wait while Figwheel is waking up ...\" ] [ :p \"(Check the js console for hints if nothing exciting happens.)\" ]]) The output window will print the defined var and then a new prompt reflecting the current REPL connection and namespace: If you then switch to the output window ( ctrl+alt+c o ), and enter this at the prompt: mount-target then evaluate it using alt+enter , you'll get: This, since the namespace \u201dfollowed\u201d the first evaluation over to the output window. REPL History Recently evaluated forms in the REPL file are persisted and can easily be shown again for modifying and re-evaluating. Navigate REPL History You can navigate up and down the last forms evaluated in the REPL file by using alt+up and alt+down , provided your cursor is at the end of the last form after the prompt. If the cursor is not at the end of the last form, then alt+up and alt+down will do what they are mapped to, which is by default \"Move Line Up\" and \"Move Line Down,\" respectively. If you have typed some text after the prompt before you start traversing up the history, this text will be preserved and will display when you traverse back down the history. If you modify some text in the history while traversing, the modification will be saved at that location in history. Clear REPL History You can clear the repl history by running the command \"Clear REPL History\" from the command palette. Stack Traces When an evaluation produces an error, the output window will automatically print the the error message. If there is a stack trace associated with the error, this can now be printed on demand using the Calva: Print Last Stacktrace to the Output Window command. The output window will also have a Codelense button below the error message that will print the stack trace.. For printed stacktraces, when source locations are available (Clojure files) you will be able to navigate to them by pressing ctrl+click ( cmd+click on Mac) on the file name. You can also hover over symbols in the stack trace to see the symbol's documentation, and ctrl+click ( cmd+click on Mac) the symbol to Peek Definition. Load Current Namespace When navigating namespaces it is easy to forget to first require them and that can be a bit tricky to fix. To help with this Calva's command Load Current File also works in the output window, but then acts like Load Current Namespace . Consider you have two files, pez/xxx.clj and pez/yyy.clj , where pez.yyy requires pez.xxx . ( ns pez.xxx ) ( def a :xxx-a ) ( def b :xxx-b ) ( ns pez.yyy ( :require [ pez.xxx ])) ( def a :yyy-a ) ( println \"Hello\" pez.xxx/a ) Then with a freshly jacked-in REPL you do (ns pez.yyy) and want to work with the vars defined there. Clojure will complain. But if you Load Current File , it will start working. Something like so: Note This currently suffers from a limitation in Calva where it won't reload dependencies, so you will sometimes have to do this \u201dmanually\u201d anyway (by opening the files and loading them). See Calva issue #907 Peek Current Namespace A somewhat hidden feature: You can see documentation for, peek and navigate to a namespace by hovering on the namespace symbol in one of the repl window prompts (just like you would if it was not in the prompt \ud83d\ude04). Paredit Enabled The output window is mostly a regular Calva Clojure/ClojureScript file, which make everything that works in a regular file work in this file, including Paredit . This makes it easy to navigate the input and output. For instance, to select the last evaluation results you can press ctrl+w ( shift+alt+right on Windows and Linux): Debugger Enabled The output window is mostly a regular... (you get it), which means you also have the Calva debugger at your command at the REPL prompt (only for clj sessions, so far). So instead of evaluating a function definition using alt+enter you can evaluate it and instrument it for debugging using ctrl+alt+c i . Then call the function. It is Ephemeral The contents of the output/REPL window is written to a file named output.repl in the .calva/output-window directory of your project. The file is recreated at every new session. And you should copy anything you want to keep from this file to wherever you want to keep it. You probably want to add .calva/output-window/ to your .<something>ignore files. (There are some more files in that directory that you shouldn't keep under source control.) Choose CLJ or CLJS REPL Connection In full stack projects, you will probably use the window as a REPL for both clj and cljs . You can toggle which REPL the window is connected to using the command Calva: Toggle REPL Connection for CLJC files . There is a button for this in the status bar: Known Quirks Due to limitations in the VS Code API it is hard for Calva to know if the output file is opened, and also if it is opened more than once. Make it a habit to leave this window opened. And if it is opened in several tabs, expect evaluation printouts to be a bit unpredictable. If you save the output/REPL file (which most often does not make much sense, but anyway) you will sometimes be presented with a message about VS Code being confused about the file contents being out of sync.

What is Paredit? Calva Paredit helps you navigate, select and edit Clojure code in a structural way. LISP isn't line or character oriented, it is based around S-expressions , a.k.a forms. We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the structural nature of Clojure, and have therefore put a lot of work into making Calva Paredit extra awesome. If you are new to Paredit, consider starting with learning the Slurp Forward (pull in the next form into this form) and Barf Forward (push the last form out of this form). It will take you quite far. Strict Mode To protect the integrity of your code, Strict mode is enabled by default. Strict mode keybinding Action Description backspace Delete Backward Deletes one character backwards, unless it will unbalance a form. Otherwise moves past the character instead of deleting it. If the list is empty, it will remove both open and close brackets. delete Delete Forward Deletes one character forwards, unless it will unbalance a form. Otherwise moves past the character instead of deleting it. If the list is empty, it is removed. alt+backspace Force Delete Backward Deletes one character backwards, even if it will unbalance a form. alt+delete Force Delete Forward Deletes one character forwards, even if it will unbalance a form. Disable at your own peril. Strict mode can be toggled on/off using the Toggle Paredit Mode command, and there is a status bar indicator telling you: Indicator Paredit Mode [\u03bb] Strict (\u03bb) Cave Man (strict mode off) \u03bb No default key bindings Toggle between Strict and Cave Man using: ctrl+alt+p ctrl+alt+m Prevent Unbalanced Closing Brackets There is also a setting, calva.paredit.strictPreventUnmatchedClosingBracket , that will help you to not enter unbalanced closing brackets into the code. Commands The Paredit commands are sorted into Navigation , Selection , and Edit . As mentioned, Slurp and Barf are power commands, which go into the editing category. Learning to navigate structurally, using shortcuts, also saves time and adds precision to your editing. It has the double effect that you at the same time learn how to select structurally, because that is the same, just adding the shift key. To make the command descriptions a bit clearer, each entry is animated. When you try to figure out what is going on in the GIFs, focus on where the cursor is at the start of the animation loop. Strings are not Lists, but Anyway... In Calva Paredit, strings are treated in much the same way as lists are. Here's an example showing Slurp and Barf , Forward/Backward List , and Grow Selection . Navigating (Modify these with shift to select rather than move, see below.) Default keybinding Action Description ctrl+right (win/linux) alt+right (mac) Forward Sexp Moves the cursor forward, to the end of the current form. If at the end, moves to the end of the next form. Will not move out of lists. ctrl+left (win/linux) alt+left (mac) Backward Sexp Moves the cursor backward, to the start of the current form. If at the start, moves to the start of the previous form. Will not move out of lists. ctrl+down Forward Down Sexp Moves the cursor into the following list. ctrl+alt+up Backward Down Sexp Moves the cursor into the preceding list. ctrl+alt+down Forward Up Sexp Moves the cursor forwards, out of the current list. ctrl+up Backward Up Sexp Moves the cursor backwards, out of the current list. ctrl+end Forward to List End/Close Moves the cursor forwards, staying within the current list. ctrl+home Backward to List Start/Open Moves the cursor backwards, staying within the current list. Selecting Most of these commands are selecting \u201dversions\u201d of the navigation commands above. Repeated use will grow the current selection step by step. Default keybinding Action Description shift+alt+right (win/linux) ctrl+w (mac) Expand Selection Starts from the cursor and selects the current form. Then will keep expanding to enclosing forms. shift+alt+left (win/linux) ctrl+shift+w (mac) Shrink Selection Contracts back from an expanded selection performed by any Paredit selection command. (In the animation the selection is first grown using a combination of Grow Selection and some lateral selection commands, then shrunk all the way back down to no selection.) ctrl+alt+w space Select Top Level Form Top level in a structural sence. Typically where your (def ...) / (defn ...) type forms. Please note that (comment ...) forms create a new top level. shift+ctrl+right (win/linux) shift+alt+right (mac) Select Forward Sexp ctrl+shift+k Select Right Select forward to the end of the current form or the first newline.

(Then you probably also want to register your own shortcuts for the commands you often use.) In some instances built-in command defaults are the same as Paredit's defaults, and Paredit's functionality in a particular case is less than what the default is. This is true of Expand Selection and Shrink Selection for Windows/Linux when multiple lines are selected. In this particular case adding !editorHasMultipleSelections to the when clause of the binding makes for a better workflow. The point is that when the bindings overlap and default functionality is desired peaceful integration can be achieved with the right when clause.

This matters because on the server all pretty printers, except pprint does more than just pretty print the result that would be printed with plain printing. Pretty printing results on the server causes some results to get expanded. This can have huge implications depending on the results and which printer is used. E.g. for Datomic transaction results, you will get the whole database printed. Twice. Depending on the database, you could be so unlucky that nothing gets printed, and instead you will soon have a very hot computer. Note: With the help of zprint creator, Kim Kinnear , we have found ways to compensate for this problem. Ways that are not yet implemented, but please stay tuned. Then why not always do it client side? It turns out that on the client side there are also things going on. Calva gets the results back as a string and therefore it needs to first be parsed back to EDN , before it can be pretty printed by zprint . And \u2013 here's the catch \u2013 all results are not valid EDN and therefore can't be pretty printed by zprint . Datomic transaction results are one example. Need More Configurability?

Read on. Consider watching this Youtube video for a demo of the workflow using the (in?)famous FizzBuzz problem as an example. Things in comment are not evaluated The Clojure comment macro is defined like so: ( defmacro comment \"Ignores body, yields nil\" { :added \"1.0\" } [ & body ]) It has no forms in its body and will therefore always (as long as the Clojure Reader can read it) evaluate to nil . That is: nothing in the (comment ...) form will get evaluated when the file is loaded . This makes it a very good \u201dplace\u201d where you can develop code, experiment with code, and keep example code. Since you will be able to load/evaluate the current file without worrying that the code in the comment form will get evaluated. This also holds true when using tools that hot-reload the code on save, such as Figwheel , shadow-cljs and Krell . To develop or refine a function you might: Open up a (comment ...) form Inside this form, type a first, super simple, version (or refinement) of your function and evaluate it Inside the same comment form, type some code to test your function and evaluate that Or type and evaluate some code you might need for your function Repeat from 2. , until the function does what you want it to do Move the function definition out of the comment form Clean up the comment form to keep some of the test code as example use, or \u201ddesign decision log\u201d for the function. Note Using (comment ...) forms for developing code is very common among Clojure coders. Rich Hickey is known for using it, which is why they are called Rich comments to begin with (even if it also is a very rich experience). Calva encourages Rich comments Calva has several features to facilitate the Rich comments workflow, e.g. A command that helps you create a new Rich comment form quickly: Calva: Add Rich Comment , ctrl+alt+r c Special Syntax highlight . By default comment forms are rendered in italics Special top-level form context Special formatting comment is top-level To make it easy to evaluate forms in (comment ...) forms, they create a new top-level context. Instead of you having to place the cursor with precision before evaluating the current form , you can have the cursor anywhere within a comment enclosed form and Evaluate Top-Level Form . This carries over to all commands in Calva which deal with the top level form. Including custom command snippets . Special formatting To invite a Rich comments workflow, the Calva command Format Current Form will not fold the closing bracket of the (comment ...) form. Instead it will place this bracket on a line of its own (or keep it there). ( comment ) With the cursor somewhere directly inside the comment form (denoted with a | ): ( comment ( def foo :foo ) | ) tab ( comment ( def foo :foo ) | ) Thinking space is kept The formatter will not remove newlines between the cursor and the closing bracket. So if you have entered a few lines to get \u201dthinking\u201d room: ( comment ( def foo :foo ) | ) tab ( comment ( def foo :foo ) | ) Fold when done To fold the trailing paren automatically, place the cursor immediately outside (before or after) the form: ( comment ( def foo :foo )) | tab ( comment ( def foo :foo )) | Enabled by default You can disable this behavior with the setting: calva.fmt.keepCommentTrailParenOnOwnLine . But why would you? It is awesome! \ud83d\ude04 Only for the Current Form Note This treatment only applies to formatting of the current form . With fold when done as an exception.","title":"Rich Comments Support"},{"location":"rich-comments/#rich-comments-support","text":"Why bother with Rich comments ? Read on.

That is: nothing in the (comment ...) form will get evaluated when the file is loaded . This makes it a very good \u201dplace\u201d where you can develop code, experiment with code, and keep example code. Since you will be able to load/evaluate the current file without worrying that the code in the comment form will get evaluated. This also holds true when using tools that hot-reload the code on save, such as Figwheel , shadow-cljs and Krell . To develop or refine a function you might: Open up a (comment ...) form Inside this form, type a first, super simple, version (or refinement) of your function and evaluate it Inside the same comment form, type some code to test your function and evaluate that Or type and evaluate some code you might need for your function Repeat from 2. , until the function does what you want it to do Move the function definition out of the comment form Clean up the comment form to keep some of the test code as example use, or \u201ddesign decision log\u201d for the function. Note Using (comment ...) forms for developing code is very common among Clojure coders.

I started to wonder what it is that shapes Calva, the VS Code Clojure Extension. I should know, being the master distiller, right?. Indeed. Poking some at the question, I do find that I have some answers. Please read the following to learn what Calva is, and, to some extent, is not, about. Read it to get an idea about which path Calva is following, where we are headed with the project, and how you can contribute to the journey. Why Calva? Calva's raison d\u00b4\u00eatre is to provide Visual Studio Code users with an easy to use and productive environment for Clojure and ClojureScript development. See the Why Calva? page for some evidence that we are succeeding. While Calva draws a lot of inspiration from CIDER , Cursive , Fireplace , and other Clojure development environments, it does not try to compete with them. Reading r/Clojure and elsewhere, it is easy to get the impression that the most common question is \"Which editor should I use for Clojure development?\u201d . I think a much more common question is \u201dHow do I use my favorite editor for Clojure development?\u201d . For VS Code users, that is where Calva should be a good choice. I also have an ambition to leverage VS Code for easing the path to Clojure. Given that it is the favorite editor for so many developers, it is important to have a good development environment in place on this platform, and to make it as easy to use as we possibly can, while also being productive and something that you want to stick with, once you are hooked on Clojure. That said, and therefore: For people who want to start out with Clojure, and do ask about what development environment would make it the most enjoyable, I'd like for Calva to be a really good option, an option so good that Clojurians feel they can recommend it. Design Goals Calva should be easy to start with and productive enough to stick with. It should support Clojure Best Practices , and be pleasant and enjoyable to use. It should also be easy to hack on, and to contribute to. The ClojureScript story keeps getting more important. Calva should contribute to making the development experience with ClojureScript delightful. Easy to Start With There are reasons as to why VS Code is so popular. Among those, one stands out to me: It is the most approachable code editor out there. There is nothing you need to learn when you start using it. The editor makes it obvious that you can start typing, deleting, cutting, pasting and undoing, without having to figure anything out. Then you learn how to bring up the command palette and get a boost few other environments can provide with such immediacy. A language extension for VS Code can leverage this, by recognizing that what's old is old, and that what's new should be as easy as possible to pick up. Coming to a new language, people bring with them a lot of expectations from the languages they are used to. This is also true for the editor support. Syntax highlighting and formatting should just work, as should documentation lookup, linting and other IDE commodities. Clojure brings some new concepts to the table. Chief among thise: The REPL. It does take some time to grasp it. Calva needs to remove any obstacles it can when it comes to helping the user to reach the REPL, in order to help getting it, and start loving it. To help the users to quickly focus on Clojure, we provide a package that is all-inclusive, with few knobs to turn, and with sane defaults for the knobs that still need to be there. Productive Enough to Stick With I think VS Code brings inspiration also when it comes to following up its excellent Getting Started story. You do not have to dig very deep under its surface to find that there is a lot more power to be unleashed. VS Code makes it easy to pick up more features as you get ready for it, and each little piece makes you more productive. To me, only Vim beats VS Code in this game. Most often there should be no contradiction between Easy to Start With and Productive . Quite the contrary. This story is mainly about being feature complete with the most important tools. As beginners start to pick up the first few features, they should be rewarded with finding more productive tools when they go looking for them. The VS Code way is Calva's way. Pleasant and Enjoyable Enjoyable starts with that Calva shouldn't be an experience full of pains. I think Calva is living up to this first bar of enjoyability. The next step is making it delightful! Calva has two main assets it can leverage for being delightful to use: Clojure and VS Code : Clojure is plain wonderful and also has this totally awesome REPL thing. Wherever we can, Calva should use the REPL to make the editor spark and bring joy to the developer. VS Code is a sweet development environment , offering its power in a consistent way across languages. Even if Clojure is very special, most of Calva's features are surfaced in the ways that VS Code encourages. It makes for less to learn for the user, and most often also makes it easier to implement functionality. Support Clojure Best Practices Mainly, I think Stuart Halloway is right about the REPL being best used from inside the files you are editing rather than from the prompt. It doesn't mean that Calva's REPL window should be neglected, but efforts should be directed such that the file editor REPL is our first way to improve the experience. Expect the Calva REPL window to get much less \u201din your face\u201d, than it is today, as the editor REPL gets stronger. Halloway also gives me some peace of mind with his reasoning of keeping a spartan setup . Calva does not need to pack every feature imaginable. If we can get the right features in place, in the right way, the mission is accomplished. Clojure is data centric. Calva should make it easy to examine data and how our code affects it. Today, this is not good enough when it comes to data structures larger than a few elements. Clojure is a LISP. Thus Structural Editing is possible, and TBH, desirable. Calva should support this and encourage it. There is little we can do about Parinfer not playing well with VS Code, but there is Paredit, and Paredit rocks! Calva's Paredit plays in the top league of Paredits, for this reason. Made from the Produce of the Orchard Calva is distilled from CIDER, which in turn is brewed from the products of The Orchard . This makes a lot of Calva's features thin wrappers around cider-nrepl and related middleware. It also should mean that we strive for adding features by thinking \u201dThe Orchard\u201d first. If it lacks what we need, we should assist in providing it there. We need to up this game a bit from where we are today, I think. Leveraging clojure-lsp Today, Calva draws a lot of its static power from clojure-lsp . As does a lot of other Clojure tooling out there. The Calva and the clojure-lsp teams work very nicely together, which is something we cherish and should take care to maintain. Project Stewardship Here Calva takes inspiration from many Clojure related projects, and perhaps most so from CIDER, shadow-cljs , and clojure-lsp. Bozhidar Batsov, Thomas Heller, and Eric Dallo all lead their projects with clarity and with gusto. You can feel how they really care about their products and their users. They are there. They listen. They respond. And they relentlessly keep improving their products. So we are there. We listen. We respond. And we keep trying to improve Calva. The Calva team cares deeply about the user experience. That is a major part of why we do this. When implementing a new feature, or changing a feature, Ux is always the first thing on our mind. Personally, to keep that direction I often start with the documentation of the feature. Reading the documentation before implementation reveals a lot about if the Ux design is within the ballpark or not. We have limited time on our hands, however, and we must cut some corners. We can't afford to spend very much time in Ux design. Rather we will use our Ux intuition, iterate the documentation quickly, and be fast to get things out. Then we are responsive in tweaking those things, based on user feedback. This also has impact on general quality at times. We only can do so much QA, and it happens that some releases of Calva cause disruptions in people's workflow because of things we haven't thought of, or not found during our testing. Again, we try to be attentive to feedback and quick to fix. Apologies in advance for any inconveniences caused! A super major part of our love for Ux is that Calva should be serving its users. That's why we treat feedback as a gift, listen intently, and use the feedback as a major ingredient in shaping Calva. Calva develops from user feedback in more direct ways as well. It is quite astonishing how many people have decided to improve on it by hacking it to do some small or big thing differently. That's great! We should make sure Calva is super easy to contribute to. There has been quite a lot of work put into improving the development process. Starting to hack on Calva is just a few steps, taking less than three minutes from cloning to running a dev version in the VS Code debugger. We encourage contributions, from the tiniest typo to whole new features. And we are ready to spend time helping people get their contributions integrated. However, Calva can't be what everyone wants it to be, that would make it useless. It needs direction and aim. And it is we, the Calva Team, who are the stewards. We need to be in charge of what Calva is about, and what it is not about. The Road Ahead Tying back to Stuart Halloway, I don't think he means that spartan needs to also mean poor. The products he helps to bring to the market tell another story. VS Code and Clojure brought together has the capacity to create something amazingly rich and luxurious. And I want Calva to tap into that potential. On the Calva journey we will allow ourselves to change our minds about how things work. Calva is not a library. Its an interface between Clojure and human beings. Human beings can adapt. And they will need to enjoy adapting in order to enjoy Calva. \ud83d\ude04 By now it should be clear that you can expect Calva to keep evolving, keep being tended and maintained, and keep getting ever more enjoyable to use. Lately we have been improving Calva pretty rapidly. It would be great to keep it up like that, but I think it is good to expect a more humble and sustainable pace. Calva is still quite new. A bit like freshly distilled Calvados. It will need time in those oak barrels to develop its full bouquet of flavors. And time is what we will give it. Our time, our creativity, and our passion.","title":"The Tao of Calva"},{"location":"tao/#the-tao-of-calva","text":"Calva , the spirit, gains much of its taste and color from the Cider it is distilled from, and the oak it is matured in.

Test on Save You can enable the Calva setting \"Test on Save\" to have tests for the current namespace run on file save. Troubleshooting Tests Are Not Found If you have tests in a test directory separate from your source directory, and those tests are not being found by the test runner, make sure the test directory is included in your paths. This will not be the case by default with a tools.deps (deps.edn) project.

Use a regular VS Code \u201dfolder window\u201d or a Workspace proper, both will totally work. You have more than one project in the repository, but only really work with one at a tine. Use a Workspace proper and add the different project directories as seperate Workspace Folders. You can only jack-in/connect to one project at a time. You have more than one project in the repository, and need to work with them in parallell. Open each project you want to work with in a separate VS Code window. One Folder - Two Windows? As is mentioned in the Calva Jack-In Guide , if you have a full stack project using a Clojure backend and a shadow-cljs frontend, you will need to open the same project in two separate VS Code windows, one for the backend and one for the frontend. This is how you can do that: Open a new VS Code window. Select File->Add Folder to Workspace... . Save the workspace as, say, Server.code-workspace . Open a new VS Code window. Select File->Add Folder to Workspace... . Save the workspace as, say, Client.code-workspace . Now, whenever you want to Jack-in to the backend and/or frontend, do it from the Server and/or Client workspace, respectively.","title":"Workspace Layouts"},{"location":"workspace-layouts/#workspace-layouts","text":"Project directory layouts can vary quite a lot. From the \u201dtemplate\u201d projects where the Clojure project files are at the root, to, well, let's just say that the project files are not always at the root.
