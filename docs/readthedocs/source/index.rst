`Calva <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva>`_ is an integrated REPL powered environment for enjoyable and productive `Clojure <https://clojure.org>`_ and `ClojureScript <https://clojurescript.org>`_ in `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_. It includes inline code evaluation, Paredit, code formatting, a test runner, syntax highlighting, and more. `Calva is open source <https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva>`_, and free to use.

Getting Started
---------------

First thing you need to do is to get `Calva connected to the REPL of your project <connect.html>`_. Then we suggest you check out `Something to Try First <try-first.html>`_.

The below list of contents is sorted in what we think is a good **Getting Started** order.

One thing to note about Calva's code formatter is that it sets the default keybinding of the **Format Current Form** command to `tab`. Good to know, right?


How to Contribute to Calva?
