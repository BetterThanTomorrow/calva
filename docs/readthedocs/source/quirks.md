# Quirks

Here's a shocker for ya': Calva isn't perfect. ðŸ˜„

There are quirks and things that flat out do not work. We'll try to collect info about such things here, providing workarounds when available (or, rather, known to us).

## Test features not available with ClojureScript

Currently [`cider-nrepl` does not provide its test functionality for ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/555) code. Please consider contributing to fixing that.

## Using with Parinfer

Calva defaults to formatting as you type. If you use Parinfer this creates a conflict, since it auto-indents your code. If you want to use Parinfer you'll have to tell Calva not to do auto-formatting by disabling `calva.fmt.formatAsYouType`.

However, with VS Code and Calva it is probably better to learn to use [Paredit](paredit.md)'s **slurp** and **barf** and generally use Calva's automatic formatting.


## MacOS and the Slurp and Barf Keyboard Shortcuts

To make slurping and barfing forward really easy to perform they are bound to `ctrl+right` and `ctrl+left`, respectively. However on MacOS those shortcuts are sometimes bound by Mission Control, causing the Calva shortcuts to not work. One way to solve it is to disable the shortcuts in *System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts*:

## Strange linting errors?
