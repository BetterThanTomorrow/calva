<!-- ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for filing a Pull Request on Calva! You are contributing to a better Clojure coding experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è
## What you can expect:

Here are some things we consider before we merge:

- We make sure the PR is directed at the `dev` branch (unless reasons).
- We figured if **anything** about the fix warrants tests on Mac/Linux/Windows/Remote/Whatever, and will help you test there if it is hard for you to do so. (We appreciate a lot if you take on the work do this of course.)
- We read the source changes. (Surprise! üòÑ)
- We given feedback and guidance on source changes, if needed. Far from everything is captured in our [code guidelines](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki/Coding-Style).
- We use our domain knowledge to try catch if you have missed some facility already provided in the code base.
- We read the updates to the documentation and help with feedback, trying to keep the documentation site serving well.
- We often check out your code changes and test them.
- We sometimes send the VSIX built from the PR out in the `#calva` channel on slack for others to test. (Actually, we will probably encourage you to do this.)
- We sometimes have a chat within the team about particular changes.
- NB: We also consider if your changes belong in the Calva product we want to maintain. Before you spend a lot of work on a PR, please consider chatting us up first, and filing issues.

We try to be speedy and attentive. Please don't hesitate to bump a PR, or contact us, if we seem to have dropped the ball (that has happened).

We use checklists in order to not forget about important lessons we and others have learnt along the way.
