# Quirks

Here's a shocker for ya': Calva isn't perfect. 😄

There are quirks and things that flat out do not work. We'll try to collect info about such things here, providing workarounds when available (or, rather, known to us).

## Test features not available with ClojureScript

Currently [`cider-nrepl` does not provide its test functionality for ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues/555) code. Please consider contributing to fixing that.

## Using with Parinfer

See [Using with Parinfer](parinfer.md)

## Calva and the VIM Extension

See [Using Calva with the VIM Extension](vim.md).

## macOS: VS Code Needs Local Network Access

On macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later, VS Code requires **Local Network** permission to connect to a REPL. Without it, Calva will fail to connect after Jack-in or when connecting to an external REPL, with no clear error message indicating the cause.

To fix this, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network** and make sure VS Code is allowed. If VS Code does not appear in the list, try connecting to a REPL first — macOS should prompt you for permission.

## “Command not found” Errors on Jack-in

[Jack-in](jack-in-guide.md) starts by running a command in a new terminal. You will need the commands used installed on your computer:

* `clojure` for tools.deps/deps.edn
* `lein` for Leiningen
* `npx` for shadow-cljs
* `gradlew` for Gradle (in your project)

Also, in some circumstances VS Code is not spawned from a shell with the environment variables, especially `$PATH`, which might mean that even though you have the tools installed, they are not found when VS Code/Calva tries to execute them. To fix this you will need to do one of these two things:

1. Figure out from where VS Code is spawned, and make sure the `$PATH` there includes the directory with the needed binary.
1. Start VS Code from a terminal where the `$PATH` is correctly configured. (Using the `code` command.)

See [this issue](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/591) for more clues on this problem.

## Strange linting errors?

This is not really a quirk, and most linting errors are not strange when you learn about why they are there. Calva does not do any linting, btw, see also [linting](linting.md).

## Consider uninstalling these extensions

Without Calva, many users install other nifty extensions (some of which are old pieces of Calva) that help with this or that problem. It might sometimes work together with Calva, sometimes not. Here's a list of some common extensions you should consider to at least disable:

* Strict Paredit - Calva Paredit has evolved a lot since that version
* Calva-fmt/Calva Formatter - Same here, evolution
* Clojure Warrior - Calva includes it, in a much evolved way
* Parinfer - This one you _can_ actually keep, _at some cost_, see [Using Calva with Parinfer](parinfer.md).
