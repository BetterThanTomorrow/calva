Very experimental

You can open any clojure file as a notebook by right clicking the file -> `Open with...` -> `Calva Notebook`.

Running cells sends them to the repl and pretty prints the results. If the return is a string that starts with `<html` it will be displayed in an html webview.

We're currently working on the tooling around autocomplete, go to def, linting and such.

We're looking forward to any feedback.
