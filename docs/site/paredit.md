# Paredit – a Visual Guide

Structural editing and navigation for Clojure.

## What is Paredit?

Calva Paredit helps you navigate, select and edit Clojure code in a structural way. LISP isn't line or character oriented, it is based around [S-expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression), a.k.a forms. We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the structural nature of Clojure, and have therefore put a lot of work into making Calva Paredit extra awesome.

If you are new to Paredit, consider starting with learning the **Slurp Forward** (pull in the next form into this form) and **Barf Forward** (push the last form out of this form). It will take you quite far.

## Strict Mode

To protect the integrity of your code, **Strict mode** is enabled by default.

Strict mode keybinding              | Action | Description
----------------------              | ------ | -----------
 `backspace`                | **Delete Backward** | Deletes one character backwards, unless it will unbalance a form. Otherwise moves past the character instead of deleting it. If the list is empty, it will remove both open and close brackets. <br> ![](images/paredit/strict-backspace.gif)
 `delete`                   | **Delete Forward** | Deletes one character forwards, unless it will unbalance a form. Otherwise moves past the character instead of deleting it. If the list is empty, it is removed. <br> ![](images/paredit/strict-delete.gif)
 `alt+backspace` | **Force Delete Backward** | Deletes one character backwards, even if it will unbalance a form. <br> ![](images/paredit/force-backspace.gif)
 `alt+delete`    | **Force Delete Forward** | Deletes one character forwards, even if it will unbalance a form. <br> ![](images/paredit/force-delete.gif)

_Disable at your own peril._ Strict mode can be toggled on/off using the **Toggle Paredit Mode** command, and there is a status bar indicator telling you:

Indicator | Paredit Mode
:-------: | ------
`[λ]`     | Strict
`(λ)`     | Cave Man (strict mode off)
 `λ`      | No default key bindings

Toggle between Strict and Cave Man using: `ctrl+alt+p ctrl+alt+m`

### Prevent Unbalanced Closing Brackets

There is also a setting, `calva.paredit.strictPreventUnmatchedClosingBracket`, that will help you to not enter unbalanced closing brackets into the code.

## Commands

The Paredit commands are sorted into **Navigation**, **Selection**, and **Edit**. As mentioned, **Slurp** and **Barf** are power commands, which go into the editing category. Learning to navigate structurally, using shortcuts, also saves time and adds precision to your editing. It has the double effect that you at the same time learn how to select structurally, because that is the same, just adding the shift key.

To make the command descriptions a bit clearer, each entry is animated. When you try to figure out what is going on in the GIFs, focus on where the cursor is at the start of the animation loop.

### Strings are not Lists, but Anyway...

In Calva Paredit, strings are treated in much the same way as lists are. Here's an example showing **Slurp** and **Barf**, **Forward/Backward List**, and **Expand Selection**.

### Navigating

(Modify these with `shift` to select rather than move, see below.)

Default keybinding      | Action | Description
------------------      | ------ | -----------
 `ctrl+right` (win/linux)<br>`alt+right` (mac)          | **Forward Sexp** | Moves the cursor forward, to the end of the current form. If at the end, moves to the end of the next form. Will not move out of lists.<br> ![](images/paredit/forward-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+left` (win/linux)<br>`alt+left` (mac)          | **Backward Sexp** | Moves the cursor backward, to the start of the current form. If at the start, moves to the start of the previous form. Will not move out of lists.<br> ![](images/paredit/backward-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+down`               | **Forward Down Sexp** | Moves the cursor into the following list.<br> ![](images/paredit/forward-down-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+alt+up`             | **Backward Down Sexp** | Moves the cursor into the preceding list.<br> ![](images/paredit/backward-down-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+alt+down`           | **Forward Up Sexp** | Moves the cursor forwards, out of the current list.<br> ![](images/paredit/forward-up-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+up`                 | **Backward Up Sexp** | Moves the cursor backwards, out of the current list.<br> ![](images/paredit/backward-up-sexp.gif)
 Unbound                   | **Forward Sexp Or Up** | Moves the cursor forward, to the end of the current form. If at the end, moves to the end of the next form. Moves out of the lists if at the end of it. <br> ![](images/paredit/forward-sexp-or-up.gif)
 Unbound                   | **Backward Sexp Or Up** | Moves the cursor backward, to the start of the current form. If at the start, moves to the start of the previous form. Moves out of the list if at the start of it. <br> ![](images/paredit/backward-sexp-or-up.gif)
 `ctrl+end`                | **Forward to List End/Close** | Moves the cursor forwards, staying within the current list.<br> ![](images/paredit/close-list.gif)
 `ctrl+home`               | **Backward to List Start/Open** | Moves the cursor backwards, staying within the current list.<br> ![](images/paredit/open-list.gif)

### Selecting

Most of these commands are selecting ”versions” of the navigation commands above. Repeated use will grow the current selection step by step.

Default keybinding    | Action | Description
------------------    | ------ | -----------
 `shift+alt+right` (win/linux)<br>`ctrl+w` (mac)                | **Expand Selection** | Starts from the cursor and selects the current form. Then will keep expanding to enclosing forms.<br> ![](images/paredit/grow-selection.gif)
 `shift+alt+left` (win/linux)<br>`ctrl+shift+w` (mac)         | **Shrink Selection** | Contracts back from an expanded selection performed by any Paredit selection command.<br> ![](images/paredit/shrink-selection.gif)<br>(In the animation the selection is first grown using a combination of **Expand Selection** and some lateral selection commands, then shrunk all the way back down to no selection.)
 `ctrl+alt+w space`      | **Select Top Level Form** | Top level in a structural sense. Typically where your`(def ...)`/`(defn ...)` type forms. Please note that`(comment ...)` forms create a new top level. <br> ![](images/paredit/select-top-level-form.gif)
 `shift+ctrl+right` (win/linux)<br>`shift+alt+right` (mac)  | **Select Forward Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-forward-sexp.gif)
  `ctrl+shift+k`         | **Select Right**          | Select forward to the end of the current form or the first newline. See **Kill right** below. (The animation also shows **Shrink Selection**).<br> ![](images/paredit/select-right.gif)
 `shift+ctrl+left` (win/linux)<br>`shift+alt+left`(mac)   | **Select Backward Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-backward-sexp.gif)
 `ctrl+shift+down`       | **Select Forward Down Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-forward-down-sexp.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 `ctrl+shift+alt+up`     | **Select Backward Down Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-backward-down-sexp.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 `ctrl+shift+alt+down`   | **Select Forward Up Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-forward-up-sexp.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 `ctrl+shift+up`         | **Select Backward Up Sexp** | ![](images/paredit/select-backward-up-sexp.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 Unbound                 | **Select Forward Sexp Or Up** | ![](images/paredit/select-forward-sexp-or-up.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 Unbound                 | **Select Backward Sexp Or Up** | ![](images/paredit/select-backward-sexp-or-up.gif) <br>(You probably do not need to select like this, but you can!)
 `ctrl+shift+end`        | **Select Forward to List End/Close** | ![](images/paredit/select-close-list.gif)
 `ctrl+shift+home`       | **Select Backward to List Start/Open** | ![](images/paredit/select-open-list.gif)

!!! Note "Copy to Clipboard when killing text"
    You can have the *kill* commands always copy the deleted code to the clipboard by setting `calva.paredit.killAlsoCutsToClipboard` to `true`.  If you want to do this more on-demand, you can kill text by using the [selection commands](#selecting) and then *Cut* once you have the selection.

!!! Note "clojure-lsp drag fwd/back overlap"
    As an experimental feature, the two commands for dragging forms forward and backward have clojure-lsp alternativs. See the [clojure-lsp](clojure-lsp.md#clojure-lsp-drag-fwdback) page.

### Drag bindings forward/backward

When dragging forms inside maps and binding boxes, such as with `let`, `for`, `binding`, etcetera, it often makes most sense to drag each binding as a pair. And this is what Calva will do. Like so:

![](images/paredit/drag-pairs-in-binding-box.gif)

And like so (wait for it):

![](images/paredit/drag-pairs-in-maps.gif)

## About the Keyboard Shortcuts

Care has been put in to making the default keybindings somewhat logical, easy to use, and work with most keyboard layouts. Slurp and barf forward are extra accessible to go with the recommendation to learn using these two super handy editing commands.

You can relax how Paredit's shortcuts replace VS Code built in shortcuts a bit by setting `calva.paredit.hijackVSCodeDefaults` to `false`.

There are some context keys you can utilize to configure keyboard shortcuts with precision. See [Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts](customizing.md#when-clause-contexts).

*The Nuclear Option*: You can choose to disable all default key bindings by configuring `calva.paredit.defaultKeyMap` to `none`. (Then you probably also want to register your own shortcuts for the commands you often use.)

In some instances built-in command defaults are the same as Paredit's defaults, and Paredit's functionality in a particular case is less than what the default is. This is true of *Expand Selection* and *Shrink Selection* for Windows/Linux when multiple lines are selected. In this particular case adding `!editorHasMultipleSelections` to the `when` clause of the binding makes for a better workflow. The point is that when the bindings overlap and default functionality is desired peaceful integration can be achieved with the right `when` clause. This is left out of Paredit's defaults to respect user preference, and ease of maintenance.

Happy Editing! ❤️

## Experimental Feature: Multicursor support

There is an ongoing effort to support simultaneous multicursor editing with Paredit. This is an experimental feature and is not enabled by default. To enable it, set `calva.paredit.multicursor` to `true`. This feature is still in development and may not work as expected in all cases. Currently, this supports the following categories:

- Movement
- Selection (except for `Select Current Form` - coming soon!)
- Rewrap
