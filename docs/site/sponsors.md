# Calva Sponsors

Calva is open source and free to use. It is actively maintained during our free time, and it keeps improving. You can contribute in many different ways, one of which is sponsoring.

If you are working at a company which benefits from Calva's existence and continued development, please consider sponsoring at the Calva Gold Sponsor tier. 

Please see [this statement from Cognitect](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/12/15/sponsoring-open-source-developers) about the importance of supporting open source developers.

## Clojurists Together

Significant additions to Calva have been made possible by funding from [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org). And this has often been transformational for the whole project. Calva would not be where it is today without Clojurists Together.
