# Something to Try First (After Connecting)

You should start with loading the file you are working with. Do this with **Load/Evaluate Current File and its Requires/Dependencies**, `ctrl+alt+c enter`.

To get a feeling for evaluating code in the editor and get immediate response from the REPL try this:

* On a new line, type a `comment` form and put some code inside it:

```clojure
(comment
  (+ (* 2 2)
      2)
  (Math/abs -1)
  (hello "Calva REPL")
  (defn hello [s]
    (str "Hello " s))
  (range 10)
  "I ♥️ Clojure")
```

Then:

1. Place the cursor behind the form `(* 2 2)` and issue the command **Calva: Evaluate Current Form**, `ctrl+enter`.
    * You should see the result being displayed inline. Press `esc` to dismiss it.
1. Now issue the command **Evaluate Current Top Level Form (defun)**, `alt+enter`.
    * You should see the whole form `(+ (* 2 2) 2)` getting highlighted and the result of that expression being displayed inline.
1. Evaluate each form inside the comment form using the **Top Level** command.
    * You should see each one of them evaluated.
    * Evaluating the `(hello "Calva REPL")` form before the `(defn hello...` form should result in an error/exception. A stacktrace is then printed in the [output window](output.md)
    * Try it again after having evaluated the `defn`form.

## How does this work?

Calva has this notion about the **current form**. Issue the **Evaluate Current Form** command, with the cursor placed in different locations to get a feeling for how the current form is determined.

There is also a concept about the **current top level form**. Good for evaluating  various `def`s `defn`, `defthis`, `defthat`. With your cursor placed anywhere inside such a form.

The Top Level command also works inside `(comment ...)` forms, treating the `comment` as creating a new top level context. It is good for in-file code experimentation.
