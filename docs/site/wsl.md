# Calva ❤️ WSL

The use of Calva with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is fully supported through the [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension. Simply install the extension and open your project with one of the `Remote-WSL` commands. Calva will run directly in the WSL environment and no further configuration is required.

## Steps Involved

1. Enable WSL
1. Install Ubuntu in WSL
1. Install Java in WSL
1. Install latest Clojure in WSL
1. Install the Remote - WSL extension in VS Code
1. Launch remote window
1. Install Calva (gets installed into the WSL instance)
1. Work away
