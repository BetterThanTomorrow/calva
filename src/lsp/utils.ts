/**
 * This will try find the most appropriate project root to use for any given document URI. This is done
 * by looking for the root-most clojure project which is still a parent of the given URI and then will
 * fall back to using the workspace root if no valid projects are found.
 *
 * For example given the following project structure:
 *
 * ---
 * root/
 *  deps.edn
 *  projects/
 *   a/
 *    deps.edn
 *    src/
 *      core.clj
 * ---
 *
 * If `core.clj` is used then it would make the most sense to start the lsp in `root/`.
 * if however `root/deps.edn` were to not exist then it would make sense to start in `root/projects/a/`.
